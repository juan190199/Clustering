Description: ClusterR is a R package that provides implementation for various clustering algorithms such as k-means,
k-medoids, spectral clustering, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN and OPTICS. These algorithms are commonly used in
unsupervised learning tasks to group similar data points together. The package is designed to be easy to use and
flexible, allowing users to customize the algorithms by adjusting various parameters and distance measures.
